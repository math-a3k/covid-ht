"One of the main services that ``covid-ht`` provides is the Classification"
" service."

#: ../../classification/index.rst:16
msgid ""
"The ``covid-ht`` project encapsulates all the classification logic in the"
" `CurrentClassifier object`_. This object performs the classification at "
"all parts of the instance and can be configured by its admin interface "
"(``/admin/base/currentclassifier``)."

#: ../../classification/index.rst:21
msgid ""
"Each instance of ``covid-ht`` provides a classification service by "
"itself, the local classifier is the one that provides such."
msgstr ""

#: ../../classification/index.rst:23
msgid ""
"The local classifier may be internal or external to the instance, "
"independently of it works, it will be the \"vote\" of the instance in the"
" context of a network or the classification result if stand-alone."

#: ../../classification/index.rst:25
msgid ""
"Internal classifiers are those integrated to the ``covid-ht`` instance "
"through the code base while external ones rely on a REST API request for "
"their service."
msgstr ""

#: ../../classification/index.rst:27
msgid ""
"You may choose either internal or external (external takes preference if "
"defined), only one will be used."

msgid ""
"If enabled by **Network Voting Policy**, the Classificatin service will "
"request to other(s) network's node(s) the classification of the data "
"requested to the instance."
msgstr ""

#: ../../classification/index.rst:38
msgid ""
"The result of the classification by the network's nodes are considered as"
" \"votes\", which, according to the **Network Voting Policy** and the "
"**Breaking Ties Policy** or **Network Voting Threshold**, will determine "
"the final result of the classification provided by the instance."
msgstr ""

#: ../../classification/index.rst:40
msgid ""
"The final score (probability in this case) of the classification will be "
"ponderated among the scores of the votes of the same class, i.e. if the "
"classification is ``POSITIVE`` the score will be the average of the "
"scores of the positive votes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../classification/index.rst:42
msgid ""
"The votes are presented in the HTML front-end automatically, for the REST"
" API see :ref:`rest_api`."
