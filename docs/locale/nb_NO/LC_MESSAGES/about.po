"Motivated by helping with the struggle against the COVID19's pandemic in "

"sufficient quantities (see :ref:`history`) and triggered by watching a "

msgid ""
"Blood Measurement (*hemogram*) is a common practice among Health "
"Professionals as part of the toolkit to diagnose and evaluate a wide "
"variety of health conditions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../about.rst:44
msgid ""
"While some of the measurements can characterize certain conditions, "
"others provide information about \"general functioning\" which may "
"reflect the ongoing of conditions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../about.rst:46
msgid ""
"Diagnosis and evaluation of conditions which take into account hemograms "
"is done by Health Professionals based on individual knowledge and "
"experience."
msgstr ""

#: ../../about.rst:48
msgid ""
"While there are specific blood measurements for COVID19, those haven't "
"been widely available in many places - i.e. Perú - having to resort to "
"other tools for the diagnosis, i.e. x-rays, tomographies, non-specific "
"Blood Measurements, etc."
msgstr ""

#: ../../about.rst:50
msgid ""
"Non-specific Blood Measurements - i.e. Complete Blood Counts - are widely"
" available, affordable and already incorporated into the Health "
"Professional practice."
msgstr ""

#: ../../about.rst:52
msgid ""
"A \"general guide\" is commonly provided in the results with reference "
"values in order to help \"classify\" the patient (i.e. healthy or non-"
"healthy)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../about.rst:54
msgid ""
"Departure from those reference values may indicate an ongoing condition -"
" i.e. bacterial or viral infection - which, with the assement of symptoms"
" (and perhaps other diagnosis tools) leads to the diagnosis and therefore"
" treatment."
msgstr ""

#: ../../about.rst:56
msgid ""
"While there are guidelines to detect an infection through hemogram "
"results, the specific effects on hemograms of COVID19 are being studied, "
"i.e. in `C-reactive protein`_ and `viscosity`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../about.rst:58
msgid ""
"*Independently of the causes of such effects, as long as those are "
"consistent to a \"considerable\" part of the population, a classifier can"
" be developed in order to improve the diagnosing toolkit of Health "
"Professionals.*"

#: ../../about.rst:60
msgid ""
"This project aims to provide a tool to efficiently build and manage that "
"classifier and make it effectively available for widespread use in order "
"to improve detection, evaluation and resource efficiency of the COVID19 "
"pandemic."
msgstr ""

#: ../../about.rst:62
msgid ""
"Early detection is deemed to be the greatest success factor in COVID19 "
"treatments."
msgstr ""

#: ../../about.rst:64
msgid ""
"Improvements in early detection should increase successful treatments, "
"potentially saving lives."
msgstr ""

#: ../../about.rst:66
msgid ""
"Improved evaluation and resource efficiency can also be achieved with the"
" tool, i.e. by only using expensive specific COVID19 testing - i.e. PCR "
"testing - for assesing full recovery when the classification of the "
"hemogram indicates so."

"`A machine-learning classifier can outperform top-level Human experts' "

msgid ""
"If this classifier achieves an adequate accuracy through hemograms and is"
" made publicly available, all Health Professionals with a smart-phone and"
" Internet access could classify any hemogram with the same accuracy as "
"top-level experts on the matter, improving the information available from"
" the measurement for the case with little to no infrastructure "
