"It generates a graph per pairwise combination of the variables specified "
"in the :setting:`GRAPHING_FIELDS` setting. Note that this variables must "
"be continuos, categorical variables are not supported at this moment. The"
" coordinates of the observation being classified will be plotted on each "
"graph with vertical and horizontal green lines."

"Setting :setting:`GRAPHING_DATASET` to ``True`` will plot the dataset "
"used for the classifier inference with blue for the ``NEGATIVE`` class "
"(not COVID19) and red for the ``POSITIVE``. It aims to provide "
"\"context\" to the observation."

"Using :setting:`GRAPHING_COND_DEC_FUNCTION` will plot in a contour form "
"the *Conditional Decision Function* on the variable combination, where "
"darker blue implies more confidence on ``NEGATIVE`` and darker red on "
"``POSITIVE``."

msgid ""
"It is conditional because it assumes the rest of the fields to be fixed "
"at the value of the observation, i.e. for an observation ``{rbc: 2, wbc: "
"2, plt: 100}``, the plot of the *Conditional Decision Function* on "
"``(rbc, wbc)`` will show how the classifier considers each point of the "
"graph *given* ``plt = 100``, colouring classification regions on that "
"plane."

msgid ""
"These planes - i.e. ``(rbc, wbc)`` - should give you the idea of how "
"\"is\" the observation relative to the classes (``COVID`` / ``NO-COVID`` "
"in this case) in those variables. **The classifier takes into account all"
" the variables together, its result may consider interactions among them "
"which may not be reflected in the planes**."

"**The score** (Probability) of the decision **is what should be taken "
"into account**, considering the metrics on the general perfomance of the "
"classifier in the context - i.e. accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, etc."

"There are some caveats on the *Conditional Decision Function*, it is "
"currently provided as a technology preview."
msgstr ""

#: ../../classification/graphing.rst:23
msgid ""
"Having this in mind, this could provide insights about specifics of the "
"observation - i.e. \"This patient has these variables in line with the "
"``COVID`` group yet these others are not\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../classification/graphing.rst:25
msgid ""
"The *Conditional Decision Function* is expensive in computational terms, "
"because of that the :setting:`GRAPHING_MESH_STEPS` can be specified to "
"control the \"density\" of the mesh in which the function will be "
"evaluated."
msgstr ""

#: ../../classification/graphing.rst:27
msgid ""
"Also, techniques which do not support NA values natively and it is not "
"implemented at an engine level have to resort to ``django-ai`` imputation"
" - i.e. SVM - which increases the computational cost."
