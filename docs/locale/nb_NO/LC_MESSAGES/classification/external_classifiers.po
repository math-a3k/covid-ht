"If an external classifier is used as the local classifier, the instance "
"will act as a proxy for classification."

"The only requirement for third-party classifiers is to implement the "
"classification endpoints (see :ref:`rest_api_classify`)."

"**Remote User** reffers to the user the instance will use to authenticate"
" its requests to the external classifier. That authentication is done via"
" a token that the external service must generate and provide to the "
"``covid-ht`` instance."

"**Metrics** are those to be evaluated on the external classifier with the"
" data in the instance. The purpose of them is to evaluate how the "
"classifier performs with the data generated from the instance's "
"population, as the classifier may have been trained or inferred with "
"another population and / or with different fields or variables."
msgstr ""

#: ../../classification/external_classifiers.rst:19

"Note that these metrics are **not cross-validated** and hence a \"not-so-"
"accurate\" estimation of their real or true values (`cross-validated "
"estimations <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-"
"validation_(statistics)>`_ are done at training time) for the instance's "
"population."

"If those metrics are not in line with the cross-validated ones reported "
